        About Us
    </h2>
        <p>
            This is my first solo website for two games that I have a lot of passion for, and thought it'd be a fun project to work on to learn what I've been studying with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is from about 3 months of experience mostly studying through apps/online, and does borrow some inspiration off other sites. <!--(add links when setting up the pull site)--> I hope you enjoy the experience, and any feedback will be appreciated! I don't plan on making many websites, but this will be used to experiment with API's, and other modules for back-end projects that will be coming later.
        </p>
